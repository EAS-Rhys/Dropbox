The Application Automation solution incorporates a Manifest Generator component, which is a React application designed to enhance the user experience and further simplify the deployment process. The Manifest Generator utilizes JSON schema specifications retrieved dynamically from GitHub Enterprise (GHE) repositories to drive the automatic generation of user interfaces for defining application manifests.

The Manifest Generator allows users to import and export the YAML definition files used in the solution, but in a guided and intuitive manner. Users are presented with a user-friendly interface that dynamically generates form fields based on the JSON schema specifications. These specifications define the structure, data types, and validation rules for the application manifest.

By leveraging the JSON schema titles and restrictions, the Manifest Generator provides users with helpful guidance and validation against all inputs. Users can benefit from features such as auto-completion, dropdown selections, and real-time validation. This ensures that the defined manifests adhere to the required format, minimizing errors and streamlining the deployment process.

The Manifest Generator also incorporates additional features to assist users in creating accurate and valid manifests. These include contextual tooltips, inline documentation, and predefined templates to guide users through the configuration process. The application validates the user input against the JSON schema, providing immediate feedback on any errors or inconsistencies.

Furthermore, the Manifest Generator supports seamless integration with the GitOps-driven release process. Users can commit and push the generated YAML definition files to the designated Git repositories, triggering the automated deployment and change management workflows within the Application Automation solution.

By leveraging the Manifest Generator, users within the bank can confidently create application manifests without the need to understand the underlying YAML structure or JSON schemas. The guided approach, validation, and assistance provided by the Manifest Generator simplify the process, reduce manual errors, and ensure compliance with the defined application standards and guidelines.
