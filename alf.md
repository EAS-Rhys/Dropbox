h2. Migration Analysis of ALF Jenkins Workloads to Zeus Platform

----

*Background:*
ALF, a devops platform, incorporates containerized devops tools within a Rancher cluster. Jenkins is the focal point, acting as a pipeline orchestrator with around 30 instances operational.

*Objective:*
The core task involves evaluating the feasibility of migrating ALF's Jenkins workloads to the Zeus platform.

*About Zeus Platform:*
Zeus represents a sophisticated build, scan, and deployment pipeline, focusing primarily on containerized workloads for OCP deployment.

*Criteria for Migration:*
Workloads suitable for migration must meet the following requirements:
- Must include a job for creating a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- To leverage Zeus fully, the built artifact should be deployable to a container-based platform.

*Current State of ALF Jenkins:*
Many Jenkins instances within ALF have not been utilized for over three months, possibly due to the transition towards Jenkins on ICP and other cloud-native orchestrators.

*Preliminary Analysis:*
- *Potential for Migration:* Approximately 45% of active Jenkins jobs in ALF may be transferable to Zeus, pending a thorough, individual analysis to ascertain full compatibility.
- *Non-Suitable Workloads:* The other 55% of jobs are employing Jenkins for general orchestration tasks, which do not conform to the strategic objectives of Zeus focused on secure build processes and controlled artifact deployment.

*Conclusion:*
A significant subset of active Jenkins jobs in ALF could potentially migrate to Zeus, although a detailed examination is imperative. It is evident that not all Jenkins workflows from ALF are in line with the strategic vision of Zeus. Moving forward, a comprehensive evaluation of individual jobs will be necessary to establish the precise viability for migration.
